# 18-NoSQL-Social-Network-API


## Description
The purpose of this project is to build a Social-Network-API. It was made to create and maintain a database using NoSql to make users, thoughts, and make reactions. Making the code for it help me understand the concept of NoSQL by following the steps and procedures of organizing files, making models, api routes, virtual properties, and joining schemas.

## Installation
Once you downloaded the file, open the terminal and cd into the correct directory.
In terminal enter 
npm i

Once all the dependencies are installed type npm run seed

Now you can run the project by typing
node server
Doing so you can go to the api like insomnia on localhost:3001

For a detailed demonstration, please refer to this video:
Included are timestamps so its easier to follow
